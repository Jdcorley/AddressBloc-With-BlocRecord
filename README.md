# Integrated Object Relational Mapping Project (BlocRecord) with AddressBloc Project

## AddressBloc was one of my first projects done in Ruby and BlocRecord was later created as an ORM project.

### This particular repository is just an integration of the two.
  - [AddressBloc](https://github.com/Jdcorley/AddressBloc) to input address information.
  - [BlocRecord](https://github.com/Jdcorley/BlocRecord) to store data persistence.
